#### Pygame GUI Framework and Retro Games Dev Toolkit
##### Developed by Clayton Powell

### What is it?

Nostalgia provides Pygame developers with a friendly GUI framework to be used for games or anything that may require a simple GUI. The main aim of this is to provide support for retro styled games. 

In the future we are looking to provide a toolkit for development of retro games. For now there is a very Alpha sprite editor tool. 

What is to come:
  * Rogue style dungeon generator
  * Heightmap generator
  * Some AI pathfinding stuff

What may come:
  * 8 bit synth for chiptune creation/editing

### What it isn't

It is not an all encompasing GUI framework (example being QT), we are shooting to support Retro games. What that means is minimal user interfaces for games. This framework will support very basic UI ideas, such as buttons, views, scenes, etc... It will not be a huge monster of different UI types to be available.

If there is a feature that you may want to see added that I may have overlooked, by all means put in a request for it. If it is within the scope for what this framework is intended to be then I will see what I can do.

### How to do I install it?

Currently we have no support for adding this package to a Python installation, but distutils support is coming soon!

### Licensing
